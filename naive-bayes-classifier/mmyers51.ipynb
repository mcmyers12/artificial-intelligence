    "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Mushroom\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment is to write a program that will learn and apply a Naive Bayes Classifier for this problem. You'll first need to calculate all of the necessary probabilities (don't forget to use +1 smoothing) using a `learn` function. You'll then need to have a `classify` function that takes your probabilities, a List of instances (possibly a list of 1) and returns a List of Tuples. Each Tuple is a class and the *normalized* probability of that class. The List should be sorted so that the probabilities are in descending order. For example,\n",

    "when calculating the error rate of your classifier, you should pick the class with the highest probability (the first one in the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, the Naive Bayes Classifier generates the un-normalized probabilities from the numerator of Bayes Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(C|A) \\propto P(A|C)P(C)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where C is the class and A are the attributes (data). Since the normalizer of Bayes Rule is the *sum* of all possible numerators and you have to calculate them all, the normalizer is just the sum of the probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need an `evaluate` function as before. You should use the $error\\_rate$ again.\n",
