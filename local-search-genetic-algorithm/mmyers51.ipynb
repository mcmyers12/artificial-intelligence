    "For this assignment we're going to use the Genetic Algorithm to find the solution to a shifted Sphere Function in 10 dimensions, $x$, where the range of $x_i$ in each dimension is (-5.12 to 5.12). Here a \"solution\" means the vector $x$ that minimizes the function. The Sphere Function is:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $n = 10$.\n",

    "## Binary GA\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to solve the problem two different ways. First, using the traditional (or \"Canonical\") Genetic Algorithm that encodes numeric values as binary strings (you don't have to represent them literally as strings but they are general lists or strings of only 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to affect this encoding. For this assignment, the easiest is probably to use a 10 bit binary encoding for each $x_i$. This gives each $x_i$ a potential value of 0 to 1024 which can be mapped to (-5.12, 5.12) by subtracting 512 and dividing by 100.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember that there is a difference between the *genotype* and the *phenotype*. The GA operates on the *genotype* (the encoding) and does not respect the boundaries of the phenotype (the decoding). So, for example, do **not** use a List of Lists to represent an individual. It should be a *single* List of 10 x 10 or 100 bits. In general, crossover and mutation have no idea what those bits represent."

    "## Real Valued GA\n",
    "\n",
    "For the real valued GA, you can represent each $x_i$ as a float in the range (-5.12, 5.12) but you will need to create a new mutation operator that applies gaussian noise. Python's random number generator for the normal distribution is called `gauss` and is found in the random module:\n",

    "## GA\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm itself will have the same basic structure in each case: create a population, evaluate it, select parents, apply crossover and mutation, repeat until the number of desired generations have been generated. The easiest way to accomplish this in \"Functional\" Python would be to use Higher Order Functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should print out the best individual of each generation including the generation number, genotype (the representation), phenotype (the actual value), the fitness (based on your fitness function transformation) and the function value (for the shifted sphere) if passed a DEBUG=True flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GA has a lot of parameters: mutation rate, crossover rate, population size, dimensions (given for this problem), number of generations.  You can put all of those and your fitness function in a `Dict` in which case you need to implement:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def binary_ga( parameters):\n",
    "  pass\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def real_ga( parameters):\n",
    "  pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that you need to transform the sphere function into a legit fitness function. Since you also need the sphere function, I would suggest that your parameters Dict includes something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parameters = {\n",
    "   \"f\": lambda xs: sphere( 0.5, xs),\n",
    "   \"minimization\": True\n",
    "   # put other parameters in here.\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then have your code check for \"minimization\" and create an entry for \"fitness\" that is appropriate."
