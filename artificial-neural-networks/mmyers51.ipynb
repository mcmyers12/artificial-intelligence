If the data is unlabeled, it will return predictions for each observation as a List of Tuples of the inferred value (0 or 1) and the actual probability (so something like (1, 0.73) or (0, 0.19) so you have [(0, 0.30), (1, 0.98), (0, 0.87), (0, 0.12)]. Note that unlike the logistic regression, the threshold for 1 is not 0.5 but which value is largest (0.98 in this case).\n",
